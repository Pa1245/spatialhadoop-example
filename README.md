This project is an example of how to use SpatialHadoop as an external library.
It uses Maven as a project management tool and adds SpatialHadoop as an
external dependency. You can compile this project from the command line by
issuing the command:

    mvn compile

You can also generate a JAR file that contains your code with the command:

    mvn package

Once the JAR file is created, you can use it along with SpatialHadoop.
